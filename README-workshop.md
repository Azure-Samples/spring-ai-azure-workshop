## Workshop Overview

The workshop consists of six examples, each with a dedicated `README` file.

All six workshop examples are organized into individual Java packages within this project. In each package, you'll find a Spring @RestController class that serves as the entry point for showcasing the discussed functionality.

To interact with the @RestController, you will be using the `http` utility as a user-friendly alternative to `curl`.

Detailed instructions and exercises for each example can be found in their respective README files:

* 1-README-tell-me-a-joke.md 
* 2-README-prompt-templating.md 
* 3-README-prompt-roles.md 
* 4-README-output-parser.md 
* 5-README-stuff-prompt.md 
* 6-README-retrieval-augmented-generation.md

These guides will walk you through the workshop exercises.
